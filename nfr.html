                    <p class="mb-30">This paper [1] provides revealing insights as to how non-functional requirements (NFRs) are (or
not) elicited, documented and validated in the software industry and how they impact
architectural decisions. It also points out glaring differences in the impetus associated to NFRs
based on system criticality and the cost to benefit ratio. The paper also reveals challenges the
industry generally faces in dealing with NFRs and classifies them based on standards already
ascertained by the engineering community (ISO/ IEC 25000). Although the study was limited to
companies in Spain, it provides a broad spectrum of organizations that are analogous to the
global software companies. The article has established the scope for more empirical studies to
be carried out with NFRs and their impact on architectural decisions. </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">The current study was based on a two part survey that dealt with NFRs in the requirements
engineering phase and then its influences on architecture. It essentially consisted of curated
interview notes and broad discussions with industry practitioners. Although these interviews do
provide revealing insights into industry practices, they may still be devoid of essential statistical
evidence. The notions about NFR management in the article could be backed by evidences like
bug reports and user story backlog analysis, provided that the companies agree to share their
data in an anonymized setting. It would also be beneficial to classify the software projects based
on their criticality in terms of safety and scale to ascertain the impetus provided to NFRs and how
it was reflected in the architecture. These could also be extended to other quality parameters.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">CHALLENGES:</br>
Cost to Benefit Perception of documentation:
Practitioners generally do not document NFRs efficiently as they do not see a clear benefit in
doing so. This is especially true in projects that cater to non-critical systems.</br>
Mitigation Strategy:</br>
A less rigorous approach to documenting NFRs in the form of concise Volere templates or natural
language documentation can be created as an aid to future artifacts. These are less resource
intensive but extremely useful when serving activities like refactoring or compartmentalizing the
code base. Also many of the quality attribute requirements can be monetized in terms of
additional features if they are unique to a software product. For example, exclusive highly
available infrastructure is monetized by Amazon Web Services and has a different pricing from
standard deployment facilities.</p>
                  <p class="mb-30">Lack of Validation for NFRs</br>
Many non- critical software projects do not validate their quality requirements and many do not
have an appropriate quality metrics to ascertain the efficacy of their systems. They also forego
important quality attributes like security.</br>
Mitigation Strategy:</br>
The authors observed that shoddy documentation practices often led to sub-par validation
schemes as well. While documenting quality attributes, appropriate and clear metrics must be
decided upon to ensure the system is working efficiently on all fronts. Automated tests can be
part of the deployment phase to ensure regressive validation.</br>
Terminology Issues</br>
The researchers observed that many of the respondents used incorrect terminology or overused
certain quality attributes pertaining to NFRs which might be a potential risk if the decision makers
are not completely aware of the wide spectrum of issues that a product might be vulnerable to
that are based on quality issues.</br>
Mitigation Strategy:</br>
Architects can use ISO/ IEC 25000 standard to clarify terminology and understand more about other
quality attributes. Organizations must provide training for their technical leaders with standard policies
regarding architectural designs or seek outside help for expertise. </br>
New Research Article:</br>
I believe this paper [2] provides a more precise and verifiable heuristic for software architectural
decision making based on non-functional quality requirements. It provides variables for resource
availability and cost and then calculates operational stages needed to achieve each soft goals
based on the NFR framework. The graph allows for easy approximation of tasks and also a scheme
to prioritize quality requirements. It also provides for impact assessments based on architectural
tradeoffs. This can potentially help architects to rely on a more concrete simulation than just
their intuition or experience.
